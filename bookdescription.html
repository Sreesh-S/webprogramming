<font size="3">A P J Abdul Kalam</font></u>

<p><i><b>The first part is all about the life of young Kalam. There is a mix of his interactions with his family, friends and teachers. The lessons he learned in through his tutelage and upbringing in Rameshwaram are beautifully dotted with black and white photographs of the period.
It also covers his early education leading up to his graduation in aeronautical engineering degree from the Madras Institute of Technology.
He hailed from a working-class Tamil Muslim family and the book is an interesting peek into the harmonious commingling of Hindus and Muslims of India celebrating the multi-ethnic, multi-religious and composite wealth India.
As a boy, he sold newspapers to help his brother and to overcome his own financial challenges while attaining his education. Through the text, the need and support of family and friends are eulogized and it certainly proved to be the cornerstone of his life's successes.</b></i></p>
